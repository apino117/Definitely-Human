# Definitely-Human

Welcome to "Definitely Human" the dating app for fellow humans (wink, wink) to find each other for various purposes!

The goal of this app is to help humans find other humans who are definitely real and not aliens. 

Definitely human is for humans. Not aliens. We cannot stress this enough *this app is not for aliens trying to find other aliens in a covert manner!!!*

To start you'll have a few different options:

# Survey
1. **Question Me!** When you click this button you'll be taken to the survey. You'll have 10 questions to answer with the varying levels of agreement that you feel per question. After you've filled in all the sections your results will be matched to another user's and your match will be displayed for you!

>**Please Note:** The survey will not submit unless you've inputted every bit of information.
